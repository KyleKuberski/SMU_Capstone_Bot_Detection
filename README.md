# SMU_Capstone_Bot_Detection_Code
Various ML Methods for Detecting Bots (SMU Capstone Project)

This code is a work in progress for our SMU Capstone team including Kyle Kuberski, Jason Yoon and Xavier Mojica .

Our project aims to use various machine learning (among other methods) to predict whether or not specified users, datascrapes, textual substance, etc... are organically (human) derived or inorganic (bot) conclusively.

Some training datasets are pulled from Kaggle, while datasets tested on are mainly scraped by myself and my team.
